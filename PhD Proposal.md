## Data Driven Metrics Applied to Traffic Crashes to Improve Observability in Smart Cities

Smart Cities are intended to be highly-connected digital cities with massive amount of Data from IoT, sensors and historical data. 
Smart Mobility solutions can benefit from real-time and historical data to better understand events and use this informationto reduce traffic congestion.  

### ODDBU Methodology
Supports the undestanding of data in a meaningful way and thus, supports the observability of smart cities.

# Enabled Network Monitoring and Measurement: Toward High-Yield Network Obserability for Digital Twin

### Active Measurement
Actively sending data packets to test the networks, however this can create a sort of Heisenberg effect, where the act of observing the network can affect the accurancy of measurement result.

### Passive Measurement
Networking monitoring involves capturing informations about the system, using logs traces and network sniffing.

The problem with Passive Measurement is that it cannot provide real-time data on network performance and may not capture as much detail as active monitoring.

### Hybrid Measurement
This kind of technique combines both active and passive measurement techniques to provide a more comprehensive view of network performace. 

## In quest of a theory of Adaptive Change

Goal of Industry 4.0: 
- Make assembly lines machine and sensors data available outside of the industrial plant offering possibilities of advanced coordination within separated industries.

Concept of "Servization" -> the economic and functional enhancement of the produced goods by offering additional services that improve customer experience related to the product itself.

# Human Machine Interface in Concept of Industry 4.0


### HMI 1.0
The first type of HMI were control rooms where buttons, diodes and clock indicators worked together
### HMI 2.0
The second revolution in HMI is desktop visualization and visualization on touch panels. 
### HMI 3.0
Internet connectivty and web servers in companies open possibilities for web and mobile applications. 
### HMI 4.0
Use of Machine Learning to react to events taking place inside the industrial plants using control system. Use of Virtual Reality and Augmented reality, this is the reason for developing the intelligent space
