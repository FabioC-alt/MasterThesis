## Data Driven Metrics Applied to Traffic Crashes to Improve Observability in Smart Cities

Smart Cities are intended to be highly-connected digital cities with massive amount of Data from IoT, sensors and historical data. 
Smart Mobility solutions can benefit from real-time and historical data to better understand events and use this informationto reduce traffic congestion.  

### ODDBU Methodology
Supports the undestanding of data in a meaningful way and thus, supports the observability of smart cities.
