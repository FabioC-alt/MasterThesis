### Intro
Service mesh creates a mesh of proxy (usually Envoy). 
The Control plane and data plane are still present and works for the aims of connecting the pods.

The benefits of the service mesh are:
- Connect
- Secure data flow
- Control The traffic 
- Observing the traffic
Drawbacks:
- Capacity and Resources -> cause the service mesh use resources
- Network Latency -> Proxies uses networking and can create latency
- Sometimes is not removable 
- Auxiliary Infrastructures


Service Mesh are used mostly for mTLS
