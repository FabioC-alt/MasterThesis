# Kubernetes Networking: Comparative Insights into API Gateways and Service Mesh Implementations

## Cloud Native Networking
Over the last decade, application development and architecture have undergone a fundamental shift. Monolithic applications have increasingly given way to microservice architectures, while containerized environments are replacing traditional bare metal and virtual machine setups. There has also been a noticeable migration from on-premise hosting to cloud-native platforms (Li et al., 2019)

### API Gateways
The traffic between clients and servers which manages a client-to-service communication can be renamed also **nort/south communcations**. 

#### API Taxonomy

**Public API**: Accessible to all users. They expose the API to a wide range of users
**Private API**: Exclusively used for internal application integrations. They are accessible only to an organization's internal user.
**Partner API:** Internal API that are also exposed to specific users outside of the organization. 

The API are used because of the different features that they can support, a classification was done.

These capabilities can be categorized into four distinct groups (Brajesh, 2017):
1. Developer Enablement for APIs
2. Secure, Reliable, and Flexible Communications
3. API Lifecycle Management
4. API Auditing, Logging, and Analytics

These capabilities are supported by three vital components within the API managment platform:

 **API Gateway**: Serves as pivotal tool for creating and managing APIs using existing data and services. It goes beyond basic connectivity allowing the addition of security measures, traffic management, interface traslation, orchestration and routing capabilities. API Gateways serves as bridges, facilitating secure, flexible and reliable communication between the boundary of consumer and provider. The fact that there is a central deployed hop (The API gateway) makes this architecture eligible for it to be called **Centralized Deployment**:

The main features of the API Gateway are:
- **Security**: because the API gateways implement a unified security measure across services, which includes the authentication, authorization, data encryption and protection against threats such as DDoS attacks and unauthorized access.
- **Traffic Management**: API gateways ensure smooth service traffic flow by employing strategies such as consumption quotas, spike arrests, usage throttling and traffic prioritization to maintain service availability
- **Interface Translation**: API gateways facilitate seamless communication between different systems by traslating between various data formats.
- **Routing**: Some API gateways direct incoming requests to the appropriate service utilizing rules for traffic direction and load balancing
- **Caching**: Some API gateways are capable of caching responses to enhance response time and reduce backend load.
- **Service Orchestration**: API gateways can coordinate complex sequences of service-to-service requests.
- **API Analysis**: API gateways provide insights into API usage patters, aiding in an organization's strategic decision making.'

**Developer Portal**: The Developer Portal is comprehensive platform that caters to developer and app registration and onboarding. It offers rich API documentation, robust community management features and can support API monetization.

**Analytics Service**: This service plays a critical role in tracking and analyzing traffic generated by individual applications. It provides metrics for organizations about the usage of APIs and their performace.

### Cloud Native API Gateways




### Service Meshes
The communications used in the framework service-to-service is instead called **east/west** and it overlaps the API Gateways features.
