# Kubernetes Networking: Comparative Insights into API Gateways and Service Mesh Implementations

## Cloud Native Networking
Over the last decade, application development and architecture have undergone a fundamental shift. Monolithic applications have increasingly given way to microservice architectures, while containerized environments are replacing traditional bare metal and virtual machine setups. There has also been a noticeable migration from on-premise hosting to cloud-native platforms (Li et al., 2019)

### API Gateways
The traffic between clients and servers which manages a client-to-service communication can be renamed also **nort/south communcations**. 

### Service Meshes
The communications used in the framework service-to-service is instead called **east/west** and it overlaps the API Gateways features.
