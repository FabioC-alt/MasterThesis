# The OTel Project
The OTel project is relevant for the telecom domain for several reasons. 
It is an horizontally-aligned telemetry framework across the three observability pillars and the goal is to keep a vendor neutral objective.
It is the result of the join between OpenTracing and OpenCensus and it is driven by CNCF.

## The key aspects

- **Horizontal with respect to the API and SDK choosen**
- **Common Data Models and Semantic Conventions**
- **Efficient Ways to collect, process and forward the data**

The OTel project is relevant to the telecom community domain for many reasons:
- Stateless Agent Deployment Model
- Pick/Choose/Design an OTel Collector
- End-to-end metric data push will result in latency reduction 
- Data Alignment results in mean time to resolve

# MultiTenancy and Observability in Smart City Platforms

The observability is the property that measures how well internal states of a system can be determined from knowledge of its external outputs.
A system is considered to be observable if the current state can be estimated using only the informations available by the outputs.
Usually in mechanical engineering this is archieved using sensors.
In ICTs the
