# Master thesis repo

This is the repo I will be using for testing, storing and documenting my master's degree thesis work at University of Bologna.

My goal is to explore the following tools for multi-cluster manament:

- [Karmada](https://karmada.io/)
- [Istio](https://istio.io/)
- [Liqo](https://liqo.io/)
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com/)
- [Avesha](https://www.avesha.io/)
- [Kubestellar](https://kubestellar.io/)

These are my guidelines for each of them:

- What do the tools do? (Do they modify the structure or create a proprietary layer?)
- What are the advantages of the two solutions above?
- What are the features?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each tool?
- What are the use cases for the tools?
