Karmada automatically migrates faulty cluster replicas in a centralized or decentralized after a cluster failure.

### Cross-cluster service governance

Done using submariner:
Submariner allows two or more cluster, with a high level of trust, to communicate and share services amongst themselves. Within a cluster set, all namespaces with a given name are considered to be the same cluster.

To connect the clusters, it uses Submariner

Cross-cluster Service Governance is performed using `ErieCanal`.
