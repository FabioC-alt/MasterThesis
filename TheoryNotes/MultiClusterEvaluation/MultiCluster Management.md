In a multicluster environment there are several variable that need to be taken into considerations.

First we need to discover the possible clusters to be grouped. That is part of the [[Service Discovery and Binding]] procedure. 

Then it is necessary to understand what is the policy for  [[Workload Scheduling]].

Communications is another important feature in the Multi-clusters environment, and in this scenario takes place the [[Networking]] solutions such as [[Istio]], which is a Service Mesh or some other solution like [[KubeSlice]] to manage the infrastructure. 

To ensure [[Communication Between Cluster]] there are several solution.
 
Managing multiple cluster can be difficult due to the complexity and this is why many [[Platform Management]] like [[Rancher]] are useful.
