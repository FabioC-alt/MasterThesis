- Hybrid Deployment
		Ability to run multiple Kubernetes Clusters in both on-premises data centers and in multiple public or private cloud environments. 
- Cross-Cloud Management
		Ability to manage Kubernetes Clusters running in multiple clouds as a single unified entity. Some solutions like the **Kubernetes Federations** or multicloud management platforms enable a centralized monitoring management and orchestration of resources across different cloud providers. Tools like [[Rancher]].
- Cloud-Agnostic Design
		Means that the kubernetes environment is not tied to any specific cloud provider or platform. 

Benefits of Adopting a Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Approach
- Avoid Vendor Lock-in
- Enhance Availability and Redundancy
- Resource Optimization and Costs Savings
- Scalability

Key Components
Cross Cloud Communications
	- VPC Peering: enables direct peering and private communications between virtual networks in different clouds. Allowds traffic to be routed securely without going over the public internet
	- VPNs: A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for secure communications between different cloud resources in a separate providers and can facilitate network traffic between Kuberenetes Clusters running in different clouds.
Service Mesh: dedicated infrastructure layer that manages communications betwen microservices, especially in multi-cloud architectures. Abstract the complexity of managing inter-service communications by providing features such as traffic routing, load environment. A service mesh can integrate services across different cloud providers and ensure seamless, secure and reliable communications.
Thanks to Service Meshes is possible to obtain the following features:
	- Traffic Management
	- Security
	- Observability


Workload Distribution and Load Balancing
These two charateristics are crucial for a Multi-cloud kubernetes environment to ensure that applications are running efficiently
